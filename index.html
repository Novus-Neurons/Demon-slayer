                        He is a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps, who joined to find a remedy to turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back into a human and to hunt down and kill demons in order to protect others from suffering the same fate as him.
                        Before he became a Demon Slayer, his entire family was slaughtered by the Demon King, Muzan Kibutsuji, while his younger sister, Nezuko, was turned into a demon as a result.</p>
                        <p>Tanjiro is very kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes and a compassionate persona.
                        He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko.
                        Even though he is relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it.
                        He is very protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister. </p>

                        He has short, yellow hair of varying lengths, cutting off squarely at the ends where it fades to a darker orange color, that falls in front of his face in uneven bangs.
                        Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's hair was originally black, but it turned the color it is currently when he was struck by lightning during his training.</p>

                         He was amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline.
                         He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age—the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.</p>

He sees no value in any humans he has encountered and shows little value in his own subordinates.

The only times he ever shows emotion are when his vision of perfection is moving forward or when he has subordinates completely submit to his will. </p>
